# Project Description: Rooster Regulation

## Overview:
The "Rooster Regulation" project aims to ensure the robustness and reliability of an experimental rooster object through the creation of a comprehensive test suite. The rooster object, currently lacking any tests, requires validation to ensure its correct functionality across various scenarios.

## Project Goals:
- Develop a fast, complete, reliable, isolated, maintainable, and expressive test suite.
- Provide confidence in the correct functioning of the rooster object.
- Serve as documentation for other developers regarding the behavior of the rooster object.

## Project Components:
1. **Rooster Object Definition:** The rooster object is defined in `index.js`, comprising methods for announcing dawn and retrieving the time at dawn.

2. **Test Suite:** Tests will be written in `index_test.js`, located within the test directory. The Mocha test framework will be utilized, along with assert methods from the Node.js standard library.

## Rooster Object Methods:
- **announceDawn:** Returns the traditional rooster call, 'cock-a-doodle-doo!', signifying dawn.
- **timeAtDawn:** Returns the hour as a string. It throws a `RangeError` if the provided hour is not between 0 and 23 (inclusive).

## Implementation Details:
- **Test Coverage:** The test suite will comprehensively cover all aspects of the rooster object's functionality, including edge cases and error handling.
- **Isolated Testing:** Tests will be designed to run independently of external dependencies, ensuring isolation and reliability.
- **Documentation:** Each test case will serve as documentation, detailing the expected behavior of the rooster object.

## Example Test Cases:
- Verify the correctness of the rooster call returned by `announceDawn`.
- Validate the behavior of `timeAtDawn` by ensuring it returns the hour as a string.
- Test error handling by verifying that `timeAtDawn` throws a `RangeError` when provided with invalid input.

## Conclusion:
Through the completion of the "Rooster Regulation" project, developers will have a robust and well-documented test suite, providing confidence in the functionality and correctness of the rooster object. This initiative contributes to the maintainability and reliability of the codebase, facilitating future development and collaboration.
